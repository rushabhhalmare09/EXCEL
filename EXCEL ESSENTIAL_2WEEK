FORMULA 

 

Addition 

                - Select a CELL, then type =, then select the cell then type + then again select a cell and repeat it till you finish and then click on enter. Example: -    =B5+B7 

 Subtraction 

     - Select a CELL, then type =, then select the cell then type - then again select a cell and repeat it till you finish and then click on enter. Example: -    =B5-B7 

Multiplication 

     - Select a CELL, then type =, then select the cell then type * then again select a cell and repeat it till you finish and then click on enter. Example: -    =B5*B7 

Division 

     - Select a CELL, then type =, then select the cell then type / then again select a cell and repeat it till you finish and then click on enter. Example: -    =B5/B7 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Functions  

    1. Functions II SUM and AUTOSUM 

               - In HOME TAB, click on AUTOSUM and select the cells you want to add. 

     2. Functions II: AVERAGE, MIN and MAX 

                - IN AUTOSUM BLOCK or TYPE = in the BOX and type initial letter and select or Above A, B, C, D column, there is a FORMULA BAR, there is fx [ Insert Function] button click on it, here we can SELECT WHAT TYPE OF FUNCTION we want then click on OK, then in next box in NUMBER1, select the CELLS we want to choose and then click OK. 

 

 

Absolute Cell References 

        - For Absolute Cell Referencing we use $ symbol. 

         Example – see in figure: -    =B4*$J$4, here  

                    $J$4 – it is J4  

         - Using Absolute Cell Referencing, we can do our calculations if a cell is outside the main group like J4 here is out of main group 

         - This above is the main difference between Relative Cell Referencing and Absolute Cell Referencing 

SHORTCUT: -  

      -   Type = then select a CELL [say =B4] then + then SELECT the cell [Say =B4+J4] and click on FN + F4 or CMD + T [ B4+$J$4 – this is what we will get ] 

 

 

 

CALCULATIONS ACROSS SHEETS 

  Data from Different worksheet 

          Select a cell where you want to do calculation 

               - in this cell – type = then go to worksheet of which data you want click on that CELL and Enter 

   For Adding two data from Different worksheet  

            Select a cell where you want to do calculation 

                  - in this cell – type = then go to worksheet of which data you want click on that CELL and type + and then go to another worksheet select the CELL and Enter 

 

 

 

 

 

Excel Terminology 

 

Formula 

A formula is entered into a cell to perform a calculation. A formula always starts with an equal sign (=) and once committed (press Enter), the result is displayed in that cell. At its most basic, formulas can be simple mathematical calculations with values much like you would type into a calculator. An example of a formula would be: =A1+B1 which would take whatever value was entered into cell A1 and add it to the value that was typed into B1. After typing the formula and pressing the Enter key, the resulting value will be displayed in the cell in which you entered the formula. 

Function 

A function is what we referred to in the videos a 'mini-program' that you can use to make more complex calculations. Functions are used inside formulas and therefore, you need to start with an equal sign (=). Formulas operate with cell references and are very powerful. One commonly used function is SUM, which will add up the values in a defined range. The function: =SUM(A1:A12) will sum up all values contained in cells A1through to A12 and return the result once you commit the function by pressing the ENTER key. 

Formula Bar 

 

The formula bar is located underneath the ribbon. The first edit line shows cell reference of the currently active cell - this is called the Name Box. The second edit line provides space to enter cell content and a helper tool to enter formulas: 

 

Once you enter an equal sign into the active cell, frequently used functions appear in the Name Box on the left - a drop-down menu offers more options. 

 

Value 

Values are numeric data that is entered into a cell. When text is entered into a cell without being assigned a number format, we refer to them as labels. When data is formatted as a value type, it can be referred to in formulas and functions and used in calculations. 

Range 

A range refers to two or more cells. When these cells are together, we call this an adjacent range. Consider this example: 

 

This adjacent range covers all the cells from A1 through to C2 - or in Excel syntax this is written as A1:C2. The colon (:) basically stands for 'through to'. Whenever we want to define a range of cells that are not all in one place, we talk about non-adjacent ranges: 

 

This range includes cells A1:A2 and C1:C2. In Excel syntax this is written as A1:A2,C1:C2. 

Reference, relative 

A relative cell reference is one that changes relative to the direction in which it is copied. Consider this example: 

 

A2 and B2 are relative cell references. When we copy the formula in C2 downwards into C3 and C4 with the fill handle, then Excel will assume that you want to conduct the same calculation in rows 3 and 4 as you did in row 2. In other words, Excel will perform the calculation A3*B3 in C3 and A4*B4 in C4. Excel effectively updates the row number in each of the cell references for every row that you copy your formula downwards. 

Reference, absolute 

Or, as we like to fondly call it, the dollar thingy. A cell reference is absolute when it does not change whenever it is copied. To make a cell reference absolute, you must include a $ before each element of the cell reference: $A$1. This can be a bit cumbersome. The keyboard shortcut to turn a cell reference into an absolute cell reference is to press F4.
